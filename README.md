# Gamer

Gamer is a web app to view and favorite video games. 

- Tailwindcss
- Laravel
- From Laracasts tutorial with custom added features.

## Why I'm building Gamer

I want to feature some of my abilities as a web developer, and get to know the Laravel 7 framework better. 
I also want to add to my public GitHub profile some work so that future employers have an idea of what I can do.
